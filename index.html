                <h2>JIBUN WO SHINJITE (PROTOTYPE #2)</h2>
                <p>The development period was two around two months (from October 2016 to December 2016)</p>
                <p>The prototype was developed in the Unity Game Engine</p>
                <p>the asset were created in Blender 3d</p>
                <p>The Idea of Jibun Wo Shinjite was a combination of mini-games
                    from the Nintendo 64, where you had to repeatedly tap a given
                    button to make your character move and Inspirational posters
                    one would see hanging in classroom or office settings. </p>
                <p>With this game I wanted the player to feel like they are
                    struggling to make the character move and in return only the
                    most motivated players would make it to the finish line,
                    hence the name means "believe in yourself" in Japanese.
                    So I thought that the best way to create that feeling was to
                    make the characters move extremely slow and make the player
                    have to tap fast to make the character move at all. With that
                    idea I proceeded to conduct research on the slowest animals on
                    earth as the roster and decided on the five animals in the
                    build.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately my idea to recreate the feeling of dread and
                    struggle worked too well when I presented the game during the
                    MAGD Expo in May 2017. I was met with criticisms on the
                    difficulty and most players leaving the game before finishing
                    the race. </p>
                <p>What I learned from this experience is that even though a concept
                    may be fun for me does not mean that it is fun for others.
                    I still see the potential in this idea so I decided to keep
                    developing it further.</p>

                <p>the assets were created in Autodesk Maya</p>
                <p>The original concept for Jibun Wo Shinjite came from a prototype
                    I worked on while working at Lexxicon Studios (July 2016).
                    The prototype name was Button Mash Racing, and the inspiration
                    for this prototype was to recreate button tapping games I
                    enjoyed from the N64 (Nintendo 64). I was only allotted one week
                    to create the prototype so by the end of the deadline I only
                    had what was shown in the video below.</p>

                <p>The assets were created in Photoshop</p>
                <p>Snag is a platformer that involves climbing and teleporting to
                    reach the top before time runs out. The theme of glitches comes
                    from a mutual appreciation from the professor that was mentoring
                    me for this class and myself. The game was developed in a short
                    amount of time in 2016 (October to December) and was developed
                    alongside Jibun Wo Shinjite.</p>
                <p>When this game was presented at the MAGD Expo alongside
                    Jibun Wo Shinjite, the reception was slightly warmer for Snag
                    but was still met with criticisms for being too confusing to 
                    control. </p>
                <p>The experience taught me that adaptive tutorials always prevail
                    over a screen of information, no matter how well you make it.</p>

                <h2>Pre-Prototype Images</h2>
                <p>The original concept of the game was to create a Surrealistic
                    game inspired by Glitches. The story was that you were a Bee
                    kicked out of the colony and had your wings ripped off and the
                    world around you would begin to erode and  glitch the farther
                    you traveled away from the hive. This idea did not live long
                    and was pivoted into Snag.</p>

                <p>This title was a lot of firsts for me as a Game Developer, It
                    was the first time I worked on a game independently, first game
                    I programmed, first game I completed, first game that got
                    positive reception, first game that was fun to play. The idea
                    to make an endless runner came about because I was doing a
                    tutorial series that taught you how to make an endless runner.
                    I decided to take the original idea and expand on it giving
                    you the ability to attack enemies and creating a parallax
                    scrolling effect to backgrounds.</p>
                <p>The development time was a total of about two months,
                    with levels 2-5 being completed in about a week.
                     (late February to early May)</p>
                <p>I presented this game at the MAGD Expo May of 2016 and it
                    received very positive reception and praise. The comments
                    consisted of how they enjoyed the level of challenge and how
                    deceptively easy the game looked to play.</p>
